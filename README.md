 # Frontend-applications

## Proces
### Week 1
* **Monday**
   * We started with a presentation about the assigment, I already had kind of a idea going on how I wanna achieve it. We also had a workshop-a-like thing to getting to know everybody. It was fun but also a bit wierd but that's okay, I enjoyed it. When the day was over we had a lovely beer with all the people.
* **Tuesday**
  * Framework presentations Angular, React and Vue
  * Choosing a framework, I vouched for react but my second choise was react because I had some experience with it, also Angular as a filler but didn't really want to do that
  * Concepting about the project, making some quick drawing to visualize my idea. Still not done but it gave ma  better understanding about the whole project
  * Bootcamp Titus Javascript summary front-end
  * This was the big day to choose a framework to work with, they gave us a presentation about 3 big frameworks (angular, vue and react). It wasn't really the part to convince us what to choose, but more to inform is what is possible and what the key points of the framework are. There were refreshing talks and ofcourse learned something from it. I kinda leaned towards going for vue but I already knew some parts of it. So after some research I vouched for react. I was really doubting about if I had to choose a less popular framework something like choo.js.
  * We also had a bootcamp from Titus, it was a quick guide through everything we learned from back and front-end. Expect the node part than. It was so refreshing and brought back alot of memories haha :).
  * I also started concepting on paper for the interface and all the features it needs to have (what I could think of than).
* **Wednesday**
  * When I started the day I knew I had to go with react. I was so happy that it was new for me and I had to dive into it. Don't really know where to start so I just booted up my machine and watched tutorials all day till I was braindead. But atleast I learned the main concept of react. We also got a indepth presentation about the project.
* **Thursday**
  * Watched another lot of tutorials and started my project, mainly creating components and trying to find some structure in my project. Because I never worked with react before I just had to guess how to structure it, kinda how I thought there was logic. Mainly I was doing some basic things trying to make some things working. Like the small things about changing data, using the states and stuff.
* **Friday**
  * The big day I finaly made my official repo and started with everything. All the things I did before I migrated into it. And started working with a plan kinda? Draw some component logic how I wanna do it and started working on it. Made a checklist for everything I wanna and avoiding trying to do all the stuff at the same time without finishing the other part.
* **Saturday**
  * The did I did actually nothing for it, some free time
* **Sunday**
  * I did in the evening something, just mainly working on trying to get the categories right and how to only show one even if there were like 1000 questions for the same category.

### Week 2
* **Monday**
  * The day started with some presentations about the workings in the field, it was really interesting to hear their side of the story and how they work. But it was still not really related to the project (ofcourse in some way)
  * With some fresh energy I started working on creating a sick router who had a sub router in it. Well that took me actually a whole day since I had no idea how to do it and had to watch alot of tutorials. In the end I didnt' even complete it when it was around 18:00. My small mental breakdown, how could I not finish something so easy :(. In the evening I tried it again after eating something than I finaly got the grasp of it and made the most sick router with a sub router ever haha.
* **Tuesday**
  * The main task for this day was that based on the category you choose, you should get the correction questions. This took a while since I had no idea how or what. I struggled alot with this since I don't wanna implement it in a hacky way so I had to try it carefully. On the end I had a great kinda stable solution. Also I did help alot of people on this day.
* **Wednesday**
  * My app was still looking like it had been made by a 3 year old. I really had to do some styling and some css magic to make it atleast kinda appealing for the eye. I got my inspiration from a project on dribble mostly for the layout and how to place the elements. I actually forgot the name of him, but shout-out for now. I still made alot of changes myself to make it way more my own. Also did some improvements to make it a little more scalable, but they are just small. Also helped alot of people.
* **Thursday**
  * One of the worst days ever, helped so many people with small stuff that I kinda forgot to work something out for my own. I wrote this awesome readme.md and imporoved some parts of the calculation. Also helped people as usually :)
  * Help alot of people
* **Friday**
  * _FINAL DATE_

## FEATURES
* Doesn't matter how many categories there are, they all get looped just right
* Some fancy router with a sub router
* Based on the category and the router you get the right quesitons for the category in a nice format
* localstorage support for the answers

### To do from the deadline

  - [X] Add SCSS/SASS support to webpack
  - [X] Try to find out how to use scoped css in components
  - [ ] Style the page so it has some kind of visual aspect to it?
  - [X] Create compontents switch user, catagories, input fields thingy, and the calculator
  - [X] Make a JSON with the question data
  - [X] Show catagories based of that data
  - [X] Routes based of the catagories (change it in the input fields thingy when clicked)
  - [X] Reusuable input UI elements
  - [ ] Use REDUX to store the data and calculations
  - [X] Make it visual appealing

### Possible ideas to make
- [X] Introduction page, popup, wizard whatever
- [ ] Export PDF
- [ ] Switch users locally
- [X] Don't use data when refreshing the page (localstorage)
- [ ] Export anonymouse
- [ ] Insighs if the percentage is higher
- [ ] Postive negative points? quesitons
- [ ] An option to add notes to it
- [ ] Import and export answers and notes

## Conclusion

Well I made it in about a week from learning to actually creating a product with it. I'm quite proud of that but when I look at the final thing on the page it took so many iterations just only under the hood. Trying to use the right tools in react for it. I found it really fun to try something new and I love react more than vue actually. You have alot more things to say and think of your own, what I really do love. But some small parts took a-lot of time. If I had to build it now again I would definitely give it another structure of components and how they should talk and react:) with each-other.

I'm happy with it all and all and learned much, also from just helping people and trying to solve their problems.
